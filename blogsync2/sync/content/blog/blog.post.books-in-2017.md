[Last year](@/blog/blog.post.books-in-2016.md) I read quite some books, unconsciously, without much thought but entirely engrossed. It bought me peace and quiet. A big chunk of it was fiction.

As a challenge of not only equalling the amount of reading I get done, I also set myself up to expand on the topics to read. This has been hard so far.

Here is a list in reverse chronological order that I finished reading. I read 30 in all. 2 of which are audio books.

#### 1. The Ministry of Utmost Happiness

_Arundhati Roy_

Notes: Heart touching, soul-crushing, nostalgia-inducing, poetry filled and an ecstasy evoking read.

Fiction straying not far from facts, blurred the lines between reality and imagined. The vivid descriptions of Delhi, J&K, the people and everything about India, has left me yearning to see them for myself in the new light shone by Arundhati Roy through her words

#### 2. Letters to a Young Poet

_Rainer Maria Rilke_

#### 3. Blind Man's Bluff

_Sherry Sontag_

Notes: I always enjoy military non-fiction. This did not disapoint although it didn't match up to my expectations of submarine warfare set with the [Thunder Below: The USS Barb](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/893889.Thunder_Below_) book
