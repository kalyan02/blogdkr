A little poetic dedication to all my fellow developers who share the plight of being unreportedly haressed by QA & Testing teams without pity! This was written in those very moments.

```txt
bugs to fix
	and bugs to swat
making life hell are qa's
	who seem good at that
oh i envy
	those testing people
for they get paid
	to cause hell & trouble
they show no mercy
	even for bugs so small
that i'd rather kill someone
	than sit to fix them all
i gather my courage
	and sit to fix it off
but before i get
	my share of pat
	for the bug i just swat
like a villain to ruin it all
	with more reports,
	they just come back
makes me wonder
	why won't they die
	oh why won't they die
or i will kill them
	untill i die
damn these dinosours
	of my life
~Kalyan
